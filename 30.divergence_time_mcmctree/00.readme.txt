1. use baseml to calculate the mutation rate.

baseml output:
Substitution rate is per time unit
    0.358417 +- 0.001040


2. calculate the rgene_gamma as the following formulaã€‚

rgene_gamma = 1/0.358417 = 1.67

3. fix the rgene_gamma in the mcmctree2.ctl and mcmctree3.ctl.

4. run mcmctree.3.ctl and give a link to it's output file "out.BV" with 'in.BV'.

5. creat two dir named 'r01' and 'r02'. copy the mcmctree2.ctl and in.BV to each dir, and running mcmctree to get the finnal results.

6. make sure the mix value around 0.3 and the two running get the similar results.
